# utserver Mobile UI

Mobile UI written in ReactJS for utserver (Utorrent server for linux), because the mobile UI 
shipped with utserver sucks and is not usable. 

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the software

1. `node` - This is everything you'll need for this project


### Installing

Just run `npm install`

### Starting server
Just run `npm start`

### Developing
Open two consoles, cd into project dir. On one console run `npm run dev`, on the other `npm start`. 
Now you can develop and have javascript bundled on-the-fly
